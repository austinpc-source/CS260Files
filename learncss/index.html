        <h2 id='header1'>Want to get a pet?</h2>
        <p>Alligators make wonderful pets. Have you ever watched a movie and wished for some company? Alligators
            are more than happy to give you a warm snuggle. Nothing feels better than the soft, warm comfort of
            alligator scales. These naturally lovable creatures will show you the affection you truly deserve.</p>
                
        <h2 id='header2'>What about their reputation?</h2>
        <p>Over the years, alligators have recieved a very misleading reputation for being cold blooded killers.
            Studies show that only 80% of all alligator pets attack their owners. This means that a delightful 20% of
            alligators are being misrepresented by the majority. </p>
        <p>It is hard to understand why people are afraid of these evolved creatures. Over the course of thousands of
            years, the alligator has become a very efficient killer. Since when do we as a society shame individuals
            for excelling at an activity. We don't get mad at atheletes for being such overachievers and alligators
            should get the same treatment.</p>
                
        <h2 id='header3'>Why should you listen to the author?</h2>
        <p>I grew up next to the marshes of Georgia. There are a few fun things to do on a crazy weekend. Alligator wrestling was
        one of those dumb activities. It turns out that it takes a special kind of insanity to get anywhere near those
        animals. The conclusion: your writer is nuts.</p>
