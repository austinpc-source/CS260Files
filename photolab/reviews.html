        <h3>Angela Schnitzel</h3>
        <p>We hired him for our wedding day photography. Again, <strong>exceptional job</strong>.
          We love his work! Also, he is very responsive and on top of the schedule.
          We will continue hiring him for our future photo shoot needs.</p>

        <p>Austin was <em>phenomenal</em>. We scheduled a shoot several weeks out,
          and he offered us many choices on where we could take photos.
          He had clear communication and fast responses throughout the lead-up to the shoot,
          even as he was out of town just days prior.</p>
        <p>We choose the Big Cottonwood Canyon location, and were so happy with the results.
          He made sure we had multiple types of images, ones with each parent and child,
          all together, and a variety of backdrops. We received over 40 stunning images which
          we are excited to print out and frame in our house.</p>
          <p>Finally, most of all, he was patient and understanding with our two kids that
            were more excited to climb and jump than sit still for long. We cannot recommend him highly
            enough!</p>

        <h3>Stevie Wonder</h3>
        <p>We couldn't be more pleased with our recent photo session of our younger son Bruno with Austin.
          My schedule, like many others, is hectic and unpredictable and Austin was able to accommodate
          through two reschedules. When we finally had our session he was able to keep up with our little
          guys energy and caught some incredible images. I highly recommend Clarke Photography! We can't
          wait for our next session to shoot both our boys!</p>
