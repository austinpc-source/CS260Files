        <h1>Nutrition</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Eat to lift. <strong>Do not</strong> lift to eat. It is true that fitness is won an lost in the kitchen<br/>
            I cannot lay out an exact plan that works universally for everybody, but there are some guidelines that<br/>
            will make it easier.</p>
        
        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Calories are the best guide to indicate if you are eating too much or too little.<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>I recommend that you use an app like myfitnesspal to get a baseline of daily caloric intake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not</strong> use this guide as an daily abosolute, but rather as an average for each day of the week.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Decide what is the most important fitness goal. Are you focussed on weight loss, building muscle, or something like cholesterol?<br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Food is broken down into three major categories. The amount of: carbs, protein, and fat to consume will be affected<br/>
                        by the overall goal.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Make sustainable goals and be happy with the small progress that is being made.</li>
        </ol>
