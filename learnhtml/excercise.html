        <h1>Excercise</h1>

        <h2>3 types of excercise</h2>
        <p>Balancing the muscles in the whole body is vital to living a happy life.<br/>
            My favorite way to split up excercises is by the motion. See each section<br/>
            to understand what muscles are being targeted.</p>
        <h3>Push</h3>
        <p>Push entails chest, shoulder, and tricep muscles. I like to start off with 3 sets<br/>
            of barbell bench press. Inline, decline, and shoulder press are essencial to building<br/>
            a well balanced upper chest. Lateral raises are perfect for building the shoulders.<br/>
            Make sure to hit the triceps using tricep press and dips.</p>
        <h3>Pull</h3>
        <p>Pull entails back and biceps. Engage the back by starting with barbell rows.<br/>
            Follow up with lat pulldowns and cable rows. The key to these exercises is to drive<br/>
            the elbows back for full contraction of the back. The biceps react well to<br/>
            bicep curls.</p>
        <h3>Legs</h3>
        <p>Legs may sound like an easy day because we only focus on one muscle group, but<br/>
            it can also be one of the most difficult days. Start by doing 4 sets of barbell squats.<br/>
            Follow this by single leg press or deadlifts. I recommend doing hamstring and quadricep<br/>
            curls. Finishing with leg sleds will leave you barely able to walk.</p>
