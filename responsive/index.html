            Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known,
              is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
              The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century
              who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum
              et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:
          </div>
          <div class="content-item">
            The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
               (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.
               A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless
               filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design,
               not content.
          </div>
          <div class="content-item">
            The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset
             used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop
             publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all
             around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our

        Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College,
          is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler
          text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
          consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin
          dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C.
          text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.
